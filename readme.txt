List of Java Projects for Repository FRC_team3793
RobotJeff - 			My first RobotBuilder Project

CameraTracker			Image tracking project from NetBeans example

PIDExample			PID Example from NetBeans

GearsBot			This is the GearsBot project with a Swing/AWT 
				front end GUI to emulate the josticks and buttons
				
GearsBotSpeedSetPoint		Proof of concept of using a velocity PID using a
				setpoint to set the robot velocity to ge the robot to 
				move straight.
				
GearsBotDiffSpeedSetPoint	Proof of concept of using a velocity pid such that
				the PID input monitors the difference in angular
				velocity of the wheels and compares it to a setpoint
				of 0.0.  This is the recommended example to use a
				PID to get the robot to drive straight.
				
PIDDrivetrain			Proof of concept of using a PID to do a fixed distance
				in autonomous mode using a command based robot.
				
CTRobot.yml			This RobotBuilder project is my interpretation of the 
				CameraSonic4 project and some extra features.
				I can see the possibility of merging this with the
				GearsBotDiffSpeedSetPoint project for the cometition.
